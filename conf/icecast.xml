  <limits>
    <!--
    Total number of concurrent clients supported by the server. Listeners are considered clients, but so are accesses to
    any static content (i.e. fileserved content) and also any requests to gather stats. These are max concurrent
    connections for the entire server (not per mountpoint).

    -->
    <sources>2</sources>

    <!--
    This is the maximum size (in bytes) of the stream queue. A listener may temporarily lag behind due to network
    congestion and in this case an internal queue is maintained for the listeners. If the queue grows larger than this
    config value, then it is truncated and any listeners found will be removed from the stream. This will be the default
    setting for the streams which is 512k unless overridden here. You can override this in the individual mount settings
    which can be useful if you have a mixture of high bandwidth video and low bitrate audio streams.
    -->
    <queue-size>102400</queue-size>

    <!--
    The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a request to come in once the client has made a connection to the server.

    <!--
    The burst size is the amount of data (in bytes) to burst to a client at connection time. Like burst-on-connect, this
    is to quickly fill the pre-buffer used by media players. The default is 64 kbytes which is a typical size used by
    most clients so changing it is not usually required. This setting applies to all mountpoints unless overridden in
    the mount settings. Ensure that this value is smaller than queue-size, if necessary increase queue-size to be larger
    than your desired burst-size. Failure to do so might result in aborted listener client connection attempts, due to
    initial burst leading to the connection already exceeding the queue-size limit.

  This section contains information relating to logging within Icecast. There are three logfiles currently generated by
  Icecast, an error.log (where all log messages are placed), an access.log (where all stream/admin/http requests are
  logged) and an optional playlist.log.

  If you set any of the filenames to a simple dash (e.g. <accesslog>-</accesslog>) then Icecast will direct the log
  output to STDERR instead of a file.

    <!--
    Into this file, all requests made to the icecast2 will be logged. This file is relative to the path specified by the
    <logdir> config value.

    <!--
    All Icecast generated log messages will be written to this file. If the loglevel is set too high (Debug for
    instance) then this file can grow fairly large over time. Currently, there is no log-rotation implemented.
